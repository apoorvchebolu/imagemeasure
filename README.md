CS 4414 Final Project
---------------------
We created an online web application, where scientists and researchers could use to measure parts of an image. Given a scale, a user can calibrate the measurements by drawing over the scale and entering a calibration value. After calibration is done, a user can measure however many number of distances they would like. 

Afterwards, a user can export the measurements as a CSV file or export the image with the line measurements. This is an invaluable tool for scientists and researchers who may need to measure cell diameters to figure out the size of the cell. Measuring cell sizes is helpful morphological information that can be used to understand the effect of a certain medical treatment.
